React - NPM (Package Manager but it is not "node package manager!!") 📦 package.json & 🔒 package-lock.json

Imp I failed in few of the interviews because of not able to answer properly on npm even though having work experience.

I just wanted to spread the knowledge what I have learnt on package manager (npm) from Namaste React done by the great soul Akshay Saini 🚀

Important to know that package manager (NPM) plays a major role in web development. So, we should have a configuration file for npm, that will maintain all packages/dependencies which we need during development & production phase.

1️⃣ package.json - This configuration file is for package manager (npm) ✔ npm init - this initializer can be used to set up a new or existing npm package Few important sections of this file - ✔ Scripts : We can keep few scripts to "starts or build or test" run easily. "npm run start or npm start" instead of "npx parcel index.html" 📍 npx - it is used to execute the package (one time) 📍 npm - it is used to install/get any package/libraries into project

✔ Normal dependencies - these are required to run the application on development & production as well.

npm install react or npm i react
npm install react-dom or npm i react-dom
✔ Dev Dependencies - these are required only during development phase.

npm install --save-dev parcel or npm i -D parcel
2️⃣ Package version details - "^2.9.3" or "~2.9.3" or "2.9.3" 2 - Major version 9 - Minor version 3 - Patches

▶ ^ keep this caret symbol if minor and patch wants to get upgraded automatically. ▶ ~ keep this tilde symbol if only patch wants to get upgraded automatically. ▶ Also, we can keep only the exact version like "2.9.3" if we want get the exact package. ▶ Major version cannot be updated automatically, it should be done manually as it will have more impact with new releases.

3️⃣ package-lock.json - It maintains the exact version of the package is installed on development server and also keeps dependent dependencies details. ✔ Transitive Dependency React project needs ➡ parcel (bundler) ➡ parcel itself needs other dependencies one such dependency is Babel ➡ Babel also will have its own dependencies ➡ this is only called "Transitive dependencies"

4️⃣ .gitignore ✔ Keep all files which can be re-generated. node_module, dist, .parcel-cache

5️⃣ package.json & package-lock.json - Using these files, we can re-generate/install all the dependencies required for the project to run on production or any system. ✔ npm install - this will install all packages/dependencies maintained in package.json and exact versions maintained in package-lock.json. 🔴 Do not update these files unnecessarily.

Keep training & keep learning until you get it right!
