//props - 
1-pass properties to the other component 
2-normal arguements to a function


//destructuring

const {resName ,cusins} = props;

//config driven UI

//put images on CDN good practice

//use destructring for render in {}

//use map,reduce inplace of for loop

//we need to give different id -- because it will not rerender in dom if that id 
exists earlier if we dont write key performance issue - react will not identify if key doesnt exists

//react official doc says dont use index as key as order can changes consider as anti-pattern
