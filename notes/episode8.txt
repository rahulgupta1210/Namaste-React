React Hooks
React Hooks are JavaScript utility functions.

useState() (80% of usage)

Provides powerful state variables in React, or special React variables.

Maintains the state of the component.

javascript
const [listofRes, setListofRes] = useState([resList]);
To modify the useState variable, pass a second parameter.

If the state changes, the component will re-render.

When data changes, it re-renders the components.

React ensures fast DOM operations by only manipulating the DOM.

Keeps the data layer and view layer in sync.

useEffect() (20% of usage)

React Algorithm
React uses the Reconciliation algorithm, also known as React Fiber (introduced in React 16).

React Fiber is a new way to efficiently find differences and update the DOM.

The Virtual DOM is a representation of the actual DOM.

The Diff algorithm finds differences between the old Virtual DOM and the new Virtual DOM, and updates the main DOM accordingly.
