Sure! Here are the explanations for each of your queries:

1. **What is CDN?**
   - **CDN** stands for **Content Delivery Network**. It's a system of distributed servers that deliver web content to a user based on their geographic location, the origin of the webpage, and the content delivery server. This helps in reducing the loading time of websites by delivering content from the server closest to the user.
      
2. **What is `crossorigin` in CDN?**
   - The `crossorigin` attribute in HTML is used to specify how the request for the linked resource should be handled regarding Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). In a CDN context, it ensures that resources are requested with appropriate credentials (like cookies, TLS client certificates) to comply with CORS policy. 

3. **React DOM as a bridge:**
   - React DOM acts as a bridge between React's `createElement` function and the browser's DOM. This means React uses `createElement` to describe what the UI should look like, and React DOM translates this description into actual DOM elements that can be rendered in the browser.

4. **Independent working of React DOM in small portions of an app:**
   - React DOM can be used to render React components in a small portion of a larger application. This makes it possible to integrate React into existing projects without needing to rewrite the entire application.

5. **React element creates an object:**
   - A React element is essentially a plain JavaScript object that describes a component instance or DOM node and its desired properties.

6. **`root.render` replacing everything inside root element:**
   - When using `root.render` in React, it replaces everything inside the root element with the rendered content. This is typically used at the entry point of a React application to render the main component.

7. **Render in React:**
   - In React, "rendering" refers to converting a React element (an object) into actual DOM elements, updating the DOM to reflect the latest state of the UI.

8. **Git commands:**
   - `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in your current directory.
   - `git branch -M main`: Renames the current branch to `main`, which is now the default branch name for Git repositories.
