Monolith Architecture:-

//whole team work on same repo.
//whole app need deployment for small changes

----------------------------------------------------------

Microservices:-
//each team work on different repo.
//single resposibility principal
//separation of concern
//all services will run in different port -diff port we can deploy diff services


approach 1

Load ---> Api--->render

approach 2

Load--->Render ---->Api ---->Rerender

React render cycle is efficient

useEffect hooks --->(hook is normal js function which has special purpose)

--React library used as named import.

useEffect(()=>{
console.log('abce')
},[])

//fetch the data in useEffect hook


//fetch used to fetch from api it is given by browser

//shimmer ui -load fake page untill we get the real data
//user will be able to anticipate the card and whatever is comin
